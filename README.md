# Polynomial Secret Solver

## Description
This project implements a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm to find the constant term of an unknown polynomial given its roots in a specific format. The polynomial is represented as:

\[ f(x) = a_m x^m + a_{m-1} x^{m-1} + ... + a_1 x + c \]

where \( c \) is the constant term that we aim to compute.

## How to Run the Code
To run the Java program, ensure you have Java installed (preferably JDK 8 or higher) and the necessary library for JSON parsing (`Gson`).

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `PolynomialSecretSolver.java` and `input.json`.
